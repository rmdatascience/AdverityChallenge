# AdverityChallenge
Detect outliers in CTR data from a previous kaggle competition

### Challenge Submission

List only the main libs you installed for your project:
	1) pandas
	2) numpy
	3) matplotlib


This project was created by:
	1) Roberto Medina, PhD


The code detect_outliers.ipynb (or .py) is located in folder src.

To run it, please deposit in the same folder the data file 'train.csv' downloadable from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction 

Only python 3.6 standard libraries were used, so it should readily run on most python environments.

However, I also include my exact environment in folder env which can be installed by:

1) Creating the environment from the rm_env.yml file
"conda env create -f rm_env.yml"
2) Run conda command tolist available enviroments
conda env list
3) Activate desired env
"conda activate rm_env.yml"
